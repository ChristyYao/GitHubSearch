# GitHubSearch
Welcome to GitHubSearch. 
GitHubSearch provides a search bar to search for GitHub users as suggested in its name. It provides the name, location, GitHub url, number of repositories, number of followers, and number of following of the searched GitHub user. However, there is an added feature to it which is to compare two GitHub users after searching both separately. Specifically, it compares the number of repositories, number of followers, and number of following of the two GitHub users. 
Created with React JS.
